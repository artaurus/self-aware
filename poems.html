        <h2>The Drop and the Sea</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          Just after it had heavily rained,<br>
          Which washed all trees & weeds so clean,<br>
          The sand was wet, & unstained,<br>
          The sea was calm with light waves seen;<br>
          <br>
          On a tree's leaf, lively & green,<br>
          Facing the sky-blue sea endless,<br>
          A drop sparkled clear & clean,<br>
          It too was meant to be, no less;<br>
          <br>
          It was but a drop tiny,<br>
          In this vast & lasting universe;<br>
          Yet its existence was shiny,<br>
          With an equally wondrous verse;<br>
          <br>
          It had just been divinely formed,<br>
          And ere long it would not ever be;<br>
          Yet it was not at all alarmed,<br>
          It knew it was no less than the sea;<br>
          <br>
          Then the leaf a breeze did scrape,<br>
          And the drop fine danced in delight;<br>
          It stretched, & then regained its shape,<br>
          Crystal clear, it balanced light;<br>
          <br>
          It could see the mighty sea,<br>
          Beyond the beach, & waving tame;<br>
          And knew its oneness with the sea:<br>
          Water in a drop & sea is the same;<br>
          <br>
          The drop was tiny, with brief a life,<br>
          The sea was vast & long lasting;<br>
          Though they differed in form & strife,<br>
          The same essence, water, was all-casting;<br>
          <br>
          So cheery & merry, the drop couldnâ€™t stop,<br>
          Identifying with self as 'water', not 'drop';<br>
          Knowing its essence was the same as sea,<br>
          It had no otherness, or differences to see;<br>
          <br>
          Likewise for the tiny & brief individual,<br>
          In this universe vast & lasting;<br>
          Differences appear in forms plural,<br>
          But the same Essence, Self, is all-casting;<br>
          <br>
          Being amidst the world of plural,<br>
          Identifying only with 'Self', not 'individual',<br>
          And knowing Essence-Self is same in all,<br>
          It's oneness without otherness with all.
