              He was the Lord's devotee staunch,<br>
              Had unwavering faith & sublime devotion;<br>
              God alone, he did see & munch,<br>
              In & thru' every motion;<br>
              <br>
              Every morn he walked the beach,<br>
              Never alone but with his God;<br>
              Four footprints then, two of each,<br>
              Trailed on the wet sands of the Lord;<br>
              <br>
              Yet things at work went sour,<br>
              And difficult times entered:<br>
              <i>“Help me thru' this hour;”</i><br>
              Was his fervent plea, God-centered;<br>
              <br>
              He went to the beach as usual,<br>
              But now saw just two footprints trail:<br>
              <i>“God, I am but a frail individual,<br>
              Without you, my train will derail!”</i><br>
              <br>
              His faith shook, but did not break,<br>
              And he left to his God his shaky lake;<br>
              <i>Ripples then slept to calm's wake,<br>
              And his present then did not bake;</i><br>
              <br>
              So at the beach then, next morn,<br>
              He saw four footprints again trail:<br>
              <i>“God, I was so mentally torn,<br>
              But you left me to lonesome sail!”<br>
              <br>
              God smiled at him & spoke divine:<br>
              “The footprints which you saw as yours,<br>
              They weren't yours, but mine;<br>
              I was carrying you, & all things yours;<br>
              <br>
              When all is well, I walk with you;<br>
              When you are unwell, I carry you;<br>
              Never ever am I not with you;<br>
              We are as one, I & you.”</i>

            <p>
              Just after it had heavily rained,<br>
              Which washed all trees & weeds so clean,<br>
              The sand was wet, & unstained,<br>
              The sea was calm with light waves seen;<br>
              <br>
              On a tree's leaf, lively & green,<br>
              Facing the sky-blue sea endless,<br>
              A drop sparkled clear & clean,<br>
              It too was meant to be, no less;<br>
              <br>
              It was but a drop tiny,<br>
              In this vast & lasting universe;<br>
              Yet its existence was shiny,<br>
              With an equally wondrous verse;<br>
              <br>
              It had just been divinely formed,<br>
              And ere long it would not ever be;<br>
              Yet it was not at all alarmed,<br>
              It knew it was no less than the sea;<br>
              <br>
              Then the leaf a breeze did scrape,<br>
              And the drop fine danced in delight;<br>
              It stretched, & then regained its shape,<br>
              Crystal clear, it balanced light;<br>
              <br>
              It could see the mighty sea,<br>
              Beyond the beach, & waving tame;<br>
              And knew its oneness with the sea:<br>
              Water in a drop & sea is the same;<br>
              <br>
              The drop was tiny, with brief a life,<br>
              The sea was vast & long lasting;<br>
              Though they differed in form & strife,<br>
              The same essence, water, was all-casting;<br>
              <br>
              So cheery & merry, the drop couldn’t stop,<br>
              Identifying with self as 'water', not 'drop';<br>
              Knowing its essence was the same as sea,<br>
              It had no otherness, or differences to see;<br>
              <br>
              Likewise for the tiny & brief individual,<br>
              In this universe vast & lasting;<br>
              Differences appear in forms plural,<br>
              But the same Essence, Self, is all-casting;<br>
              <br>
              Being amidst the world of plural,<br>
              Identifying only with 'Self', not 'individual',<br>
              And knowing Essence-Self is same in all,<br>
              It's oneness without otherness with all.

              In the Divine Plan universal,<br>
              Is Earth, with living beings global;<br>
              Of which the human being classical,<br>
              Can perceive, feel, & think, able;<br>
              <br>
              Man can turn a heaven into hell,<br>
              When unkind thoughts & actions swell;<br>
              Or can turn a hell into heaven,<br>
              When kind thoughts & actions pen;<br>
              <br>
              Heaven & hell are not geographical,<br>
              They are states of one's own mind;<br>
              <i>A disturbed & fearful mind is hell,<br>
              Divine love in mind is heavenly kind;</i><br>
              <br>
              In harmonic times, healthily helpful,<br>
              Chirping & roving & merrily free;<br>
              <i>But picking up dust, Self-forgetful,<br>
              From dust to dust, it leads silently;</i><br>
              <br>
              Enter pandemic times, harmfully viral,<br>
              Quarantined by hellish limits & fear;<br>
              <i>Clean & clear, with the Self nondual,<br>
              And to enlighten, spiritually steer;<br>
              <br>
              The Self is Consciousness, all-enlivening;<br>
              The Self is everywhere, all-pervading;<br>
              The Self is indivisible, without a part;<br>
              The Self is full, lacks nothing at Heart;</i><br>
              <br>
              Ignorant of own Supreme Self State,<br>
              Man leaves peace & bliss for worldly slot;<br>
              With repeated birth & death, as fate,<br>
              Has stories of that which truly is not!<br>
              <br>
              From <i>vasana, ignorance of the Self,</i><br>
              As the causal body, beyond thought level,<br>
              A subtle body rises, mind-intellect of self,<br>
              And forms a  physical gross body, to dwell;<br>
              <br>
              One then identifies not with the Self,<br>
              But identifies with the bodies in reel;<br>
              With egoic attitudes of an illusory elf,<br>
              Has desires to fulfill, & happy feel;<br>
              <br>
              Then, at individual, or collective a level,<br>
              Own mind becomes a heaven or hell;<br>
              <i>Hell is a mind agitating you viral,<br>
              Heaven is when in divine love you dwell;</i><br>
              <br>
              Like, coronavirus in mind is a fearful hell,<br>
              With dis-ease, decay, & death's swell;<br>

              Know your Real Self, & nondual run,<br>

              In oneness with all, as Self own,<br>
              With divine love and kindness sown;<br>
              Yet beyond terrestrial kiss & hiss,<br>
              Self-aware, in eternal peace & bliss!<br>
              <br>
              Perceive the Self, O Sun of Suns!<br>
              Feel the Self, the Consciousness!<br>
              Think as the Self, O Glorious Ones!<br>
              And be in unbroken happiness.</i>
