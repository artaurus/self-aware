        <h2>The Dis-ease</h2>
        <br>
        <p><i>Ignorance of your Real Self; the universal, ever-full, peaceful, and blissful Self.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>Consequently, this brings up thoughts, desires and emotions, and actions to fulfill them. By which you do experience a few elevating joys, but more of harmful negatives like agitations, stress, and strain. Dis-ease by the disease of ignorance.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>The Cure</h2>
        <br>
        <p><i>Self-develop with the three spiritual disciplines - karma yoga, bhakti yoga, and jnana yoga for union with goal Self-realization - Self-aware</i> then in duties, give words and deeds essential to goal.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Consequently, desires and their harmful negatives reduce, while helpful positives like a charitable attitude and noble emotions rise. Enhancing the quality of the unending stream of experiences.</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Being Self-aware,</i> youth can design, study and work on a thought-out career and other obligatory duties.</li>
          <br>
          <li><i>Being Self-aware,</i> those who tend to get stressed, like professionals and businesspersons, can steer towards mental peace despite intense action.</li>
          <br>
          <li><i>Being Self-aware,</i> a sincere and devoted seeker can attain <i>Self-realization, God-realization, and reach the Ultimate State, Enlightenment</i>. The permanent cure.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Think ...</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Activities, actions and thoughts are forces of your choice. They consume energy. To use them optimally, productively, clip non-essential activities and thoughts. And act in the present on an essential task in hand.</p>
        <br>
        Actions, perceptions, feelings and thoughts of the mind don't agitate, stress or strain you. Identifying with the mind does.</p>
        <br>
        For peace and happiness, develop the intellect and use it to govern the mind, and also to shift perception from mind to <i>Self</i>.</p>
        <br>
        <i>Your Real Self is Brahman, Consciousness. Ever-full, peaceful, blissful.</i> Identify with <i>that Self</i> through essential actions, perceptions, feelings and thoughts. <i>Thereby being Self-aware, attentive, productive.</i></p>
        <br>
        Perceive, and remember <i>the Self</i>.</p>
